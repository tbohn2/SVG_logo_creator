# SVG Logo Creator

## Description

This application generates a SVG file for a basic logo, customized with user input. The user is prompted for three characters to go on the logo, the text color, the background shape (options are square, triangle or circle), and background color. These elements are used to generate the SVG file called 'logo.svg' which can be viewed in a browser.

## Installation

Node.js must be installed for application to function. Instructions can be found at https://nodejs.org/en/download for download.

Inquirer.js must be installed following instructions at https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer#installation for prompt functionality.

## Test

To run test file 'shapes.test.js', Jest.js must be installed following instructions at https://jestjs.io/docs/getting-started. After installation, run 'npm run test' in terminal to test the functionality of the shape classes created in 'shapes.js'.

## Usage

To generate a basic SVG logo, after installing node.js and inquirer.js, the user enters 'node index.js' in the terminal to start application and answers the prompts accordingly. The SVG file created can then be renamed and moved as desired.
